```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load libraries and settings here
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    warning = FALSE,
    message = FALSE,
    comment = "#>",
    fig.path = "figs/", # Folder where rendered plots are saved
    fig.width = 7.252, # Default plot width
    fig.height = 4, # Default plot height
    fig.retina = 3 # For better plot resolution
)

# Load data below here

# Put any other "global" settings here, e.g. a ggplot theme:
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 20))
```

# Settings 

Make sure you update the settings in the YAML for your report. 

Also note that I've added `code_folding: hide` to the settings - this adds a drop-down menu at the very top so that your code chunks can be hidden or shown on command. It makes for a nice, more polished report. 

# Template structure 

## Folders

There are four folders in this template:

1. `data_raw`: This is where you should put all of your "raw" data used in your analysis. **Put the files there, then NEVER touch them again.** Opening the raw file in a program like Microsoft Excel can (and often will) corrupt your data file. If you feel you _must_ open the data file in Excel to look at it, then create a copy of the raw data, open and look at the _copy_, then **DELETE IT**. This will leave your "raw" data untouched and uncorrupted.

2. `data_processed`: If you create any processed or "cleaned" up data frames in R that you want to export, save them in this folder. This can be helpful, for example, if the data processing takes a long time to run. In that case, you might want to create a separate .R file called `clean_data.R` (or something like that) where you clean and save the data. Then you can just read in the pre-processed data from the `data_processed` folder.

3. `figs`: This is where any chart you create inside a code chunk will be saved.

4. `images`: Sometimes you'll want to include images other than those generated by code in your report - put those here. For example, I put the class sticker called `eda_hex_sticker.png` in this folder. 

## Files

There are three files:

1. `project.Rproj`: Open this whenever working on your project to make sure that you are in the correct working directory.

2. `report.Rmd`: (i.e. this file) Write your report in this file. Write code and text together, then compile it to a single html file that you can then share with others to communicate your analysis.

3. `report.html`: This is the compiled report. Once you're done writing your `.Rmd` file, click the "knit" button in RStudio to create this file.

# Writing your report

Use [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) to format your document, e.g. use the `#` symbol for a level 1 header, the `##` symbol for a level 2 header, etc. 

Run R code using chunks like this:

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

Create charts and change the name and dimensions by changing the chunk settings, like this:

```{r scatterplot, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(mtcars) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = hp))
```

Finally, if you want to insert an image in the `images` folder, you can insert it using html code like this: 

<center>
<img src="images/eda_hex_sticker.png" width=150>
</center>

The code `<center>` and `</center>` just puts the image in the center of the page, the `src=""` part defines the path to the image, and the `width=300` part defines the image width in pixels - use that to adjust the image size in your report.
