# Using the YAML data in your document!

In last week's template, I showed how to use `params` in the YAML. But you can also access any of the standard YAML elements, like the `title` or `author`.

For example, if you wanted to insert the author name somewhere in your document, you can insert it like this: `r rmarkdown::metadata$author`.

What's going on here? Well, we're using the {rmarkdown} library to access the `metadata` object, which gets created when you render the document. Any of the fields defined in the YAML are accessible from the `rmarkdown::metadata` object. Cool!
