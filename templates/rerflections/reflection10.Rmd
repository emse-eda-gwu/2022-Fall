# Reflection

List the link to the article you read here:

Put any notes you took as you read the article here:

Answer these questions:

- What was one main conclusion or point the author made?
- Were any of the visualizations particularly effective in grabbing your attention and supporting that point?
- Was there anything you could critique about the article or charts you saw?

# Make a chart

Make your static plot here:

```{r}
plot <-
```

# Make it interactive

If you've installed the `plotly` library, your chart should magically turn into an interactive chart with this one function:

```{r}
ggplotly(plot)
```
