### Description

This course provides students with data analysis techniques to inform
design decisions in an uncertain, competitive market; topics include
consumer choice modeling, programming in the [R programming
language](https://www.r-project.org/), survey design, conjoint analysis,
optimization, market simulation, and professional communication skills.
Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory
and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an
emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate
design insights. At the end of the semester, students will submit a
final, reproducible report of their project along with a presentation of
their findings. This course has a “flipped” classroom structure.
Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding
practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class,
students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and
reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice
questions.
