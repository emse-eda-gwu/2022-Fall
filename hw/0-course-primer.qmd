## This assignment is optional

Students should have taken [EMSE 4574: Intro to Programming for Analytics](https://p4a.seas.gwu.edu/) prior to taking this course.

For those who did not, I **strongly** suggest you go through all the lessons in this primer course:

> [R for Analytics Primer](http://jhelvy.github.io/r4aPrimer/)

After completing these lessons, you should be able to:

 - Use RStudio to write basic R commands.
 - Know the distinctions between different R operators and data types, including numeric, string, and logical data.
 - Use **tidyverse** functions to wrangle and manipulate data in R.
 - Use the **ggplot2** library to create plots in R.

Also, it can be very helpful to see these skills applied in practice. Take a look at [this example](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tidyverse-tutorial-r) of using Tidyverse tools to explore and visualize data on survivors aboard the Titantic. It's a good example of conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights about a data set.
