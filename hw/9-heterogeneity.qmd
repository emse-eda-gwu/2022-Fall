params:
  number: 9
  purpose: "The purpose of this assignment is to introduce the concept of preference heterogeneity - that is, not everyone has the same preferences. We will see two ways to account for this: 1) specify preference parameters as distributions, and 2) estimate fixed parameter models on different sub-groups in your data."
