This page lists all the software we'll be using in class.

> You should install and set everything here _before_ the first day of class.

1. Install / setup these tools:

- [Slack](`r settings$slack`): You can find a sign up link on the announcement in Blackboard.
- Install the Slack app on your phone and **Turn notifications on!**

2. Install the latest version of R and RStudio:

- [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org) (version 4.0.2 or higher)
- [Download and install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Desktop version)

**We will always work in RStudio**, so be careful to open RStudio and not the default R application that comes with R:

<div style="width:200px">
Open this   | Not this!
:----------:|:----------:
![](images/rstudio_ball.png){ width=50 }  |  ![](images/Rlogo.png){ width=50 }
</div>

3. Sign up for [RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free) (the free version). It's basically the same thing as RStudio, but accessible via a web browser. If things aren't working on your computer, this is a great backup to quickly get back to working in R!

That's it - you're all set for class!
