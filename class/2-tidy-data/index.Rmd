# Your turn: Reshaping Data

Open the `practice.Rmd` file. 

Run the code chunk to read in the following two data files:

- `pv_cell_production.xlsx`: Data on solar photovoltaic cell production by country
- `milk_production.csv`: Data on milk production by state

Now modify the format of each:

- If the data are in "wide" format, convert it to "long" with `pivot_longer()`
- If the data are in "long" format, convert it to "wide" with `pivot_wider()`

**Approach 1**: Create new `total` by adding each variable

  select(year, total)

# Your turn: Tidy Data Wrangling

Open the `practice.Rmd` file. 

Run the code chunk to read in the following two data files:

Now convert the data into a tidy (long) structure, then create the following summary data frames:

- Mean life expectancy in each year.
- Mean GDP in each year.

### Data provenance - It matters where you get your data

--

**Validity**:

- Is this data trustworthy? Is it authentic?
- Where did the data come from?
- How has the data been changed / managed over time?
- Is the data complete?

--

**Comprehension**:

- Is this data accurate?
- Can you explain your results?
- Is this the right data to answer your question?

--

**Reproducibility**:

- I should be able to fully replicate your results from your raw data and code.

---

## `r fa("magnifying-glass")` **Document your source like a museum curator**

**Example**: View `README.md` file in the `data` folder

--

Whenever you download data, you should **at a minimum** record the following:

  - The name of the file you are describing.
  - The date you downloaded it.
  - The original name of the downloaded file (in case you renamed it).
  - The url to the site you downloaded it from.
  - The source of the _original_ data (sometimes different from the site you downloaded it from).
  - A short description of the data, maybe how they were collected (if available).
  - A dictionary for the data (e.g. a simple markdown table describing each variable).

# Your turn

Documentation in the "data/README.md" file is missing for the following data sets:

- wildlife_impacts.csv: [source](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-07-23)
- north_america_bear_killings.txt: [source](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w21)
- uspto_clean_energy_patents.xlsx: [source](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/report/sections/industry-technology-and-the-global-marketplace/global-trends-in-sustainable-energy-research-and-technologies)

Go to the above sites and add the following information to the "data/README.md" file:

- The name of the downloaded file.
- The web address to the site you downloaded the data from.
- The source of the _original_ data (if different from the website).
- A short description of the data and how they were collected.
- A dictionary for the data (hint: the site might already have this!).

# Writing a research question

Follow [these guidelines](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/how-to-write-a-research-question) - your question should be:

--

- **Clear**: your audience can easily understand its purpose without additional explanation.

--

- **Focused**: it is narrow enough that it can be addressed thoroughly with the data available and within the limits of the final project report.

--

- **Concise**: it is expressed in the fewest possible words.

--

- **Complex**: it is not answerable with a simple "yes" or "no," but rather requires synthesis and analysis of data.

--

- **Arguable**: its potential answers are open to debate rather than accepted facts (do others care about it?)

---

# Writing a research question

--

**Bad question: Why are social networking sites harmful?**

- Unclear: it does not specify _which_ social networking sites or state what harm is being caused; assumes that "harm" exists.

--

**Improved question: How are online users experiencing or addressing privacy issues on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter?**

- Specifies the sites (Facebook and Twitter), type of harm (privacy issues), and who is harmed (online users).

---

# Writing a research question

**Example from previous classes**: 

- [Genders in the Workforce](https://eda.seas.gwu.edu/showcase/2021-Spring/gender_pay_gap.html): How has the US gender wage gap changed over time for different occupations and age groups?
- [NFL Suspensions](https://eda.seas.gwu.edu/showcase/2021-Spring/nfl_suspensions.html): What factors contribute to the severity of disciplinary actions towards NFL players from 2002-2014?

**Other good examples**: See the [Example Projects Page](https://eda.seas.gwu.edu/2022-Fall/help/example-projects.html) page
