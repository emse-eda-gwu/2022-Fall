    "text": "This course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nThis course was inspired by many other courses / resources that cover similar material. In addition to my own developed material, I have also modified material from other courses and workshops - a full list of sources can be found in the LICENSE page.\nThis course was originally created by Dr. John Paul Helveston at the George Washington University for the Spring 2020 semester."

This analysis uses some statistical modeling (which won’t cover), but the use of visualizations alone are effective for addressing the research questions posed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF1 racing data analysis\nby Jonathan Bouchet. This is an extensive exploratory data analysis of a variety of data on races, drivers, and constructors across the history of Formula 1 racing. This would probably be overkill for a course project, but sections of it (e.g. section 3 on the races, or sections 4 and 5 together on the drivers and constructors) would make a nice project. It involves mutliple data sets, some not-so-simple data cleaning, and a wide variety of nice visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing Intensity of Strong Atlantic Hurricanes\nby James B. Elsner. This is a short analysis with the goal of validating the predictions of this study published in Nature in 2008, which predicted that Atlantic tropical cyclones would continue to get stronger on average over time. While this analysis is too short to be considered adequate for a final project, it is still a good example of good data source documentation and one effective visualization. An expanded inquiry into the questions addressed here would make a good course project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath: Reality vs Reported\nby Owen Shen. This is an interesting original analysis in which the author collected the data himself. The analysis compares whether the proportion of actual causes of death is consistent with the proportion of death causes that the media reports. This analysis also uses some interactive graphics so that the reader can view different versions of the same plot, such as scrolling through the plot over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre first babies more likely to be late?\nby Allen Downey. This is another relatively short analysis, but the author does a good job of documenting his data sources, stating the assumptions he makes, and also describes what data were dropped from the analysis (i.e. babies born via C-section).\n\n\n\n\nHistorically significant analyses\nExploratory data analysis has been around for a very long time. Here are some of the most historically famous.\n\n\n\n\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois’ “The Exhibit of American Negroes”\nIn 1900, W.E.B. Du Bois presented “The Exhibit of American Negroes” at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Du Bois described the exhibition as “Thirty-two charts, 500 photographs, and numerous maps and plans form the basis of this exhibit. The charts are in two sets, one illustrating conditions in the entire United States and the other conditions in the typical State of Georgia.” The charts in his exhibition are staggeringly powerful. This six-part series published in Nightingale displays and discusses many of his impressive visualizations. You can also purchase a book on the portraits on Amazon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinard’s Napoleon March Map\nThe “Napoleon March Map” by Charles Joseph Minard is widely viewed as one of the greatest data visualizations of all time. The chart depicts Napoleon’s disastrous campaign to conquer Moscow. Having started with around 470,000 soldiers, he returned with just 10,000. The width of the line represents the total number of soldiers and the color represents the direction (yellow for towards Moscow, black for the return trip).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTableau’s Top 10 GOAT Data Visualizations\nIt’s hard to say which data visualizations are the “Greatest Of All Time,” but Tableau put together a pretty excellent collection for their top 10 list."

As you scroll though it, take note in your reflection this week of some of the key points you remember from the article. Answer these questions:\n\nWhat was one main conclusion or point the author made?\nWere any of the visualizations particularly effective in grabbing your attention and supporting that point?\nWas there anything you could critique about the article or charts you saw?\n\n\n\n3. Make a chart\nNow that you’ve seen some interactive charts, make a simple, static chart in the chunk provided in your reflection.

We will start choosing colors and fonts more carefully, and we will also annotate our charts with informative text.\nAssessment: This assignment is graded using a check system:\n\n✔+ (110%): Responses shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often.\n✔ (100%): Responses are thoughtful, well-written, and show engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.\n✔− (50%): Responses are hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.\n\nNotice that this is essentially a pass/fail system. I’m not grading your writing ability and I’m not counting the number of words you write - I’m looking for thoughtful engagement. One or two sentences is not enough. Write at least a paragraph and show me that you did the readings assigned.\n\n\n1. Get Organized\nDownload and edit this template when working through this assignment.\nThen unzip the template folder (make sure you unzip it!), then open the .Rproj file to open RStudio. Open the hw9.Rmd file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the following.\n\n\n2. Readings\nThis week we’ll get into the weeds with techniques for polishing up your charts. This is a critically important step for making your charts easy for others to understand and effective as a central tool for communicating important results. It’s also where you can be highly creative!\n\nHow to polish ggplot charts: R4DS Chapter 28 - Graphics for communication\nWilke: 4 - Color scales\nRost: Which color scale to use when visualizing data\n\n\n\nOptional\n\nWilke: 21 - Multi-panel figures\nCheck out the patchwork package for merging multiple charts together\nHow to make a multi-panel figure with a shared legend.\nCheck out this tool for simulating color blindness.\nCheck out these tools for customizing your Rmd file: PIMP my Rmd\n\n\n\n3. Practice polishing\nGo back to a previous homework where you made a chart (e.g. hw6). Using some of the principles in the readings you just read, try to make a more polished version of your figure.\n\n\n3. Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your hw9.Rmd file. Here are some suggestions:\n\nDiscuss some of the key insights or things you found interesting in the readings or recent class periods.\nWrite about the messiest data you’ve seen.\nConnect the course content to your own work or project you’re working on.\n\nDo you have a favorite font / color / color palette? Share it in your reflection this week!\n\n\n4. Knit\nClick the “knit” button to compile your hw9.Rmd file into a html web page. Then open the hw9.html file in a web browser and proofread your report.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Department: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nWrite a clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable research question.\nImport, manipulate, clean, visualize, and export data in R.\nWrangle data from its original format into a fit-for-purpose format.\nConduct a systematic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of different types of data.\nApply fundamental principles of visualizing information for exploratory analysis and communication.\nGet data off the web and expose data, code, results on the web.\nGenerate fully reproducible reports that contain code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n\nPrerequisites:\nStudents should have taken EMSE 4571: Intro to Programming for Analytics or have experience working with data in at least one programming language. If you’re not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing this optional course primer assignment before class starts. Once class starts, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics."

    "text": "For your final project, you will take a dataset, explore it, tinker with it, and tell a nuanced story about it using at least three key charts. I want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible - you’ll hopefully want to show off your final project in a portfolio or during job interviews. Accordingly, you get to choose what data you will use for your project. Choose whatever one you are most interested in or will have the most fun with.\n\nCheck out these examples of other exploratory data analyses for inspiration\n\nFor the final project, you will:\n\nWrite a research question.\nConduct an exploratory data analysis of one or more data sources to address your research question.\nCreate visualizations to effectively communicate the results of your analysis using the principles of information visualization covered in this course.\nDocument your entire analysis in a reproducible format, including a detailed curation of the data you used as well as your analysis and results.\n\nPurpose: The skills covered in this course are rooted in design rules and principles rather than formulas and equations. As such, the application of these principles to a real data problem is one of the best ways to learn and assess mastery of these skills. I guarantee you one day you will need to apply these principles to communicate an idea to colleagues, so let’s make sure you have at least one chance to practice before the stakes are higher.\nSkills & Knowledge: Your final project should illustrate your ability to transform raw data into insights by making the non-visible visible, showing clear trends or patterns, and / or identifying outliers or missing information. The specific skills involved in achieving this goal include all of the course learning objectives.\nTeams: Your final project will be a team project made up of 2 to 3 classmates of your choosing. Teams will be finalized at the time of submitting your proposal. Graduate students taking the course must work on individual projects.\nSummary of Deliverables: To make the overall project more manageable, it is broken down into separate “milestone” deliverables due throughout the semester, starting with a proposal due just before spring break.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nWeight towardsfinal grade\nDue Date(by 11:59pm)\n\n\n\n\nProposal\n9 %\nOct 04\n\n\nProgress Report\n12 %\nNov 01\n\n\nFinal Report\n16 %\nDec 11\n\n\nPresentation\n9 %\nDec 13"

    "text": "Due: Sep 27 by 11:59pm\nWeight: This assignment is worth 8% of your final grade.\nPurpose: When you start looking for data to address your project for this course, you will inevitably come across some rather messy data. Fear not! After completing this assignment, you will be well-prepared to tackle the messiness of real-world data! This assignment will put your data wrangling and cleaning skills to the test and will challenge you to become a master data janitor!\nAssessment: Your submission will be assessed using the rubric at the bottom of this page.\n\n\nBackground\nFor this assignment, you’ll be cleaning up a data set from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA). Your job for this assignment is to clean up a relatively messy data file that contains sales of passenger cars by country in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Your final product should be a tidy (long format) data frame with three columns: country, year, and sales. It should look like this:\n\nhead(df )\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 3\n  country    year   sales\n  <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 Argentina  2019  333226\n2 Australia  2019  799263\n3 Austria    2019  320381\n4 Belgium    2019  550008\n5 Brazil     2019 2262073\n6 Bulgaria   2019   35371\n\nThat’s the goal - in this assignment, we’ll walk through how to get there step-by-step.\n\n\n1. Get organized\nDownload and unzip this template for your project, then open the report.Rproj file.\nOnce RStudio opens, click on the report.Rmd file. That is the primary file you will edit to conduct your analysis.\n\n\n2. Document the data\nInside the data folder, there is a README.md file with some missing information. Click on that file and edit it to fill in the missing information. Here is some info that will help:\nThe main data file we’ll be working with is the pc_sales_2021.xlsx file in the data folder. You can find this file online at https://www.oica.net/category/sales-statistics/. The link to the original data file can be found by right-clicking on the Excel icon on the right side of the page, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Preview the data\nWith messy Excel files, it is often helpful to first open and view them so you can learn about what might be needed to clean them up in R, such as how many lines you may need to skip at the top when reading in the data. To make sure Excel doesn’t corrupt your data, make a copy of the Excel file and open that copy with Microsoft Excel. You can keep that copy open throughout your data cleaning journey and can be confident that you haven’t corrupted the original file!\n\n\n4. Load the data\nUse the read_excel() function from the readxl package to read in the pc_sales_2021.xlsx data file. Make sure you use the sheet argument to specify which sheet to read in as well as the skip argument to specify how many lines to skip at the top of the file.\n\n\n5. Clean the names\nWhen reading in a messy data file, one of the first things you’ll want to do is clean up the names. Follow these steps:\n\nUse the clean_names()function from the janitor package to clean all the names.\nUse the rename() function to change the name of the column that contains country names to country.\n\n\n\n6. Reshape the data\nThe data are clearly in a “wide” format because the last three columns are labeled as years, but the values in those columns are sales. We’ll want to reshape that into just two columns: year & sales. To do so, follow these steps:\n\nUse the select() function to keep only the columns with country names and sales numbers (some of the columns report percent growth - we want to drop those).\nUse the pivot_longer() function to reshape the data into a long format structure with the following names: country, year, and sales.\n\n\n\n7. Convert year to a number\nOur data now have a tidy structure, but the values under the year column is a character with values like this in it: q1_q4_2019. We need to get rid of those pesky q1_q4_ things and just keep the year value. Follow these steps:\n\nUse the separate() function with sep = \"_\" to split up the year variable into three columns. You can use the into argument to give the new columns new names, such as c(\"drop1\", \"drop2\", \"year\"). This will convert year into three columns: one containing the q1 value, another containing q4, and the last one containing the year values.\nOnce you’ve got those columns split up, you can use the select() function to drop the columns containing the q1 and q4 values.\nFinally, use mutate() to convert the year column to a numeric type.\n\n\n\n8. Drop rows that aren’t countries\nThis step is probably the messiest step. The country column contains a mix of countries and whole regions (e.g. \"EUROPE\"). We only want countries, so we need to use filter() to drop rows that contain regions. I’ve done you a favor by listing all of the regions in the data as a vector below - you can copy-paste it to use in filtering out these rows:\n\nregions <- c(\n    \"EUROPE\",\n    \"EU 27 countries + EFTA + UK\",\n    \"OTHER COUNTRIES\",\n    \"RUSSIA, TURKEY & OTHER EUROPE\",\n    \"AMERICA\",\n    \"NAFTA\",\n    \"AFRICA\",\n    \"CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA\",\n    \"ASIA/OCEANIA/MIDDLE EAST\",\n    \"ASEAN\",\n    \"ALL COUNTRIES/REGIONS\",\n    \"OTHER COUNTRIES/REGIONS\",\n    \"TOTAL OICA MEMBERS\"\n)\n\nWhen finished filtering out the regions, convert the country values from “upper” case to “title” case (e.g. \"FRANCE\" should become \"France\").\n\n\n9. Rearrange the rows\nUse the arrange() function to sort the rows by year and country.\n\n\n10. Save the cleaned file\nSave your cleaned data frame to your data folder as a CSV file. Name the file my_clean_data.csv.\n\n\n11. Knit your report\nClick the “knit” button to compile your .Rmd file into a html web page. Then open the report.html file in a web browser and proofread your report. Does all of the formatting look correct?\n\n\n12. Submit\nTo submit this assignment, create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment. Name the zip file mini1-netID.zip, replacing netID with your netID (e.g., mini1-jph.zip). Then copy that zip file into the “submissions” folder in your Box folder created for this class (the Box folder is named your GW netID).\n\n\nBONUS: Make a summary visualization (+5%)\nFor a 5% bonus, add a code chunk at the bottom of your report to generate the plot below. If your cleaned data is not properly formatted, you can read in the pc_sales_clean.csv file and use it to make the plot.\nSome hints to perfectly replicate the figure:\n\nConsider using ifelse() to make a new variable for the bar color based on the country variable.\nYou can use fct_relevel() to re-order the country factors (the order of how they are stacked).\nThe fill colors are 'grey', 'red', and 'blue'.\nThe theme is theme_minimal().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading Rubric\n\n35 Total Points\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Category \n    Excellent \n    Good \n    Needs work \n  \n \n\n  \n    Organization & Formatting \n    5All formatting guidelines are followed; YAML is correctly filled out. \n    4Most formatting guidelines are followed; YAML is correctly filled out. \n    3Several or all formatting guidelines not followed; YAML contains elements that aren't updated from the template; template file wasn’t used. \n  \n  \n    Data Documentation \n    5The README file included in the template was updated with thoughtful and accurate information about the data. \n    4The README file included in the template was updated, but some of the information was missing or inaccurate. \n    3The README file included in the template was not updated, missing, or most of the information in it was inaccurate. \n  \n  \n    Data Cleaning \n    18 - 20All cleaning steps are completed and the resulting \"clean\" data frame is exactly (or very close to) the desired final state. \n    15 - 17All cleaning steps are completed, though there are one or two significant errors that prevents the resulting \"clean\" data frame from being in the desired final state. \n    10 - 14More than one of the cleaning steps are missing; multiple errors prevent the resulting \"clean\" data frame from being in the desired final state. \n  \n  \n    Technical things \n    5All code runs without errors; the html file can be compiled from the Rmd; all files included in the submitted .zip file. \n    4Code has only one or two error, otherwise runs; all files included in the submitted .zip file. \n    3Code has multiple errors; html file cannot be rendered without significant changes to the Rmd file; submitted .zip file is missing components necessary to reproduce analysis."

But that’s often easier said than done. The purpose of this assignment is to give you a chance to practice some of the techniques we’ve discussed in class for exploring a data set.\nAssessment: Your submission will be assessed using the rubric at the bottom of this page.\n\n\n1. Get organized\nDownload and unzip this template for your project, then open the report.Rproj file.\nBe sure to delete / replace any of the existing text / code in the template before submitting - the template text is just there as a helpful guide\n\n\n2. Load the data\nFor this assignment, you’ll be exploring data on the costs of hundreds of transit projects around the world collected by the Transit Costs Project. The data span more than 50 countries and totals more than 11,000 km of urban rail built since the late 1990s.\nWrite code to load the transit_cost.csv file in the “data” folder.\n\n\n3. Document the data\n\nFormat: This can just be a single paragraph describing the data sources.\n\nGo to this GitHub page and read about the data we’ll be using (that’s where I got the data in from). In your report.Rmd file, document the original data source as well as the source from where you downloaded the data. Note that the GitHub page is not the original data source - it is just a repository where someone else put the data.\n\n\n4. Preview the data\n\nFormat: This can be a mix of code chunks and written text. It is more for you than me - think of this like jotting down notes to help you understand what is in the data.\n\nPreview the data (e.g. using head(), glimpse(), View(), and / or make some quick plots). Take note of what variables are available, their types, and what they measure (Hint: look at the data dictionary on the GitHub page!).\n\n\n5. Identify research questions\n\nFormat: Use a numbered list to list each question and the associated variables you will explore.\n\nOnce you have a sense for the available variables in the data, list at least three questions you think you may be able to answer with these data (you can list more if you want). For each question, also note which variables you plan to explore to address the question. A question can be about what the data captures (e.g. “Which countries in the data have the longest total amount of projects in km?”) or about a relationship between different variables (e.g. “Are projects with tunnels more expensive on a $/km basis than projects without tunnels?”).\nNote: It is okay if you end up not being able to answer your question - just write down what you think you might be able to find out by exploring the data.\n\n\n6. Explore the data\nGo through each of your questions and search for answers. You should include at least one visualization for each question (so a minimum of 3 charts total).\nFor each question, follow these steps:\n\nIf necessary, modify the transit_cost data frame to address your question. For example, you may need to create new variables (e.g. using mutate()), filter the data (e.g. if you’re only interested in a single country, year, etc.), or you may want to rename some of the variables. For this task, you’ll be relying on your data wrangling skills.\nExamine summary measures (centrality, variability, correlation) in the variables relevant to your question by making charts and / or printing out summary values / tables. Your chart(s) should be appropriately chosen according to the data type and / or relationship you are searching for. At this stage in the course, don’t worry to much about how “pretty” your charts looks - we’ll get better at polishing our charts throughout the class. Just make sure they are clear and legible.\nFor each research question, write at least one paragraph describing what you found. If you found an answer to your question, make sure you have included at least one chart (or a few charts if appropriate) that helps explain your answer. If this process did not lead to an answer your question, write about how you might adjust your question or perhaps what other data you may need to address your question.\n\n\n\n7. Knit your report\nClick the “knit” button to compile your report.Rmd file into a html web page. Then open the report.html file in a web browser and proofread your report. Does all of the formatting look correct? Did your plots render as expected? Does the text you wrote support / align with the plots you made?\nTreat your report as if you were going to send it to a publisher. Consider changing the theme and make sure all the formatting is neat and tidy.\n\n\n8. Submit\nTo submit this assignment, create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment.

    "text": "Due: Nov 15 by 11:59pm\nWeight: This assignment is worth 8% of your final grade.\nPurpose: At some point in your career, you will likely be involved in creating or revising a summary chart of some data. When that happens, you will also likely be the most knowledge person in the room about what to do to design the chart(s) to effectively communicate the information in the data. This assignment is a practice run for that day.\nAssessment: Your submission will be assessed using the rubric at the bottom of this page.\n\n\nBackground\nThe American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) is a national trade association that advocates for the wind power industry. They also publish data on wind power statistics in the U.S. The authors of this article at howmuch.net got a hold of some of this data and published this unfortunate chart:\n\n \n\n\nFor this assignment, you will use the ggplot2 library in R to redesign the above chart. In this redesign, we are interested in exploring this question:\n\nWhich states are leaders in wind energy?\n\nThe answer depends on what you consider a “leader” to be. For example, the authors of the above chart clearly viewed the installed capacity as the most important metric to highlight. But this chart also contains lots of other data, such as the amount of money each state invested and the number of homes powered by wind in each state. Some states may be leading in other ways, such as the capacity built per dollar of investment.\nWith that in mind, here’s what you need to do for this analysis:\n\n\n1. Get organized\n\nDownload and unzip this template for your project, then open the report.Rproj file.\nUpdate the YAML with your name, a title, the date, etc.\nDelete any of the existing text / code in the template before submitting - the template text is just there as a helpful guide.\n\n\nPoints will be taken off for failing to follow these basic organizing steps.\n\n\n\n2. Load the data\nUse this link to download the US_State_Wind_Energy_Facts_2018.xlsx file and put it in your data_raw folder. Here is some information on the data:\nDescription: Data on which US states produce the most wind energy.\nSource of downloaded file: The formatted Excel spreadsheet was downloaded from data.world: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w8\nOriginal source: The primary source is the American Wind Energy Association (https://www.awea.org/), but the source for this particular data was found on this article, which cites the AWEA.\nData dictionary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRanking\nRank order of state by installed capacity\n\n\nState\nU.S. state\n\n\nInstalled Capacity (MW)\nInstalled capacity in MW\n\n\nEquivalent Homes Powered\nNumber of homes powered by wind power\n\n\nTotal Investment ($ Millions)\nTotal Investment in $ millions\n\n\nWind Projects Online\nNumber of projects currently online\n\n\n# of Wind Turbines\nNumber of wind turbines in state\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Preview the data\nIn the setup chunk in your report.Rmd file, write code to read in the excel sheet, then write code to preview the data, e.g. using head(), glimpse(), View(), and / or make some quick plots (Hint: look at the top and bottom!). Take note of what variables are available, their types, what they measure, and if there are any missing values. (Hint: Read the data dictionary!) Are all the variables encoded the way you would expect (e.g. are numbers encoded as numbers?)\n\n\n4. Clean the data\n\nWrite code to modify variable types and names to get your data frame cleaned up for analysis. As you do so, I recommend that you modify some of the column names (especially those with spaces in them) to make your analysis easier. (Hint: The clean_names() function from the janitor package is a life saver!)\nWrite a few sentences describing any modifications you made to the original data and why you did it.\n\n\n\n5. Summarize the data\n\nExamine measures of centrality and variability in the important variables relevant to our research question. Remember that we’re interested in the states that are “leaders” in wind energy. While installed capacity is an obvious choice to look at, you should also look at summaries of other values, such as the amount of money invested, and at least two other computed measures, such as the capacity per dollar invested (Note: you’ll need to create new variables to do this!).\nWrite a few sentences explaining your summary measures and what you learned from them.\n\n\n\n6. Visualize the data\n\nCreate an appropriate visualization that highlights leadership in installed capacity. This chart should be a substantial improvement over the original visualization, and it should follow the design principles we have covered in class.\nCreate a second visualization that highlights “leadership” in another metric of your choice. This could be one of the existing variables or a variable you computed. Your chart and design choices should highlight the metric you chose and should have a clear message to convey. Again, this chart should follow the design principles we have covered in class.\n\nYour charts should be polished. Points will be taken off for poor design principles, illegibility, etc.\n\n\n7. Summarize your analysis\nWrite a summary of your analysis process. I’m specifically looking for a discussion of the following:\n\nWhat was wrong with the original chart? Discuss specific design principles we have covered in class.\nDiscuss the improvements your first revised chart makes compared to the original chart.\nDiscuss what message your second chart conveys and what design choices you made to highlight that message.\n\n\n\n8. Knit your report\nClick the “knit” button to compile your .Rmd file into a html web page. Then open the report.html file in a web browser and proofread your report. Does all of the formatting look correct? Did your plots render as expected? Does the text you wrote support / align with the plots you made?\nTreat your report as if you were going to send it to a publisher.\n\n\n9.

Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings."

You will not be told in advance when there is a quiz, and make up quizzes will not be available if you miss it (except for excused absences). Please show up on time to class each week to ensure that you do not miss a quiz.\nQuizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz. Quizzes are short (5-10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."
