    "text": "Department: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nWrite a clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable research question.\nImport, manipulate, clean, visualize, and export data in R.\nWrangle data from its original format into a fit-for-purpose format.\nConduct a systematic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of different types of data.\nApply fundamental principles of visualizing information for exploratory analysis and communication.\nGet data off the web and expose data, code, results on the web.\nGenerate fully reproducible reports that contain code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n\nPrerequisites:\nStudents should have taken EMSE 4571: Intro to Programming for Analytics or have experience working with data in at least one programming language. If you’re not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing this optional course primer assignment before class starts. Once class starts, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics."

    "text": "For your final project, you will take a dataset, explore it, tinker with it, and tell a nuanced story about it using at least three key charts. I want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible - you’ll hopefully want to show off your final project in a portfolio or during job interviews. Accordingly, you get to choose what data you will use for your project. Choose whatever one you are most interested in or will have the most fun with.\n\nCheck out these examples of other exploratory data analyses for inspiration\n\nFor the final project, you will:\n\nWrite a research question.\nConduct an exploratory data analysis of one or more data sources to address your research question.\nCreate visualizations to effectively communicate the results of your analysis using the principles of information visualization covered in this course.\nDocument your entire analysis in a reproducible format, including a detailed curation of the data you used as well as your analysis and results.\n\nPurpose: The skills covered in this course are rooted in design rules and principles rather than formulas and equations. As such, the application of these principles to a real data problem is one of the best ways to learn and assess mastery of these skills. I guarantee you one day you will need to apply these principles to communicate an idea to colleagues, so let’s make sure you have at least one chance to practice before the stakes are higher.\nSkills & Knowledge: Your final project should illustrate your ability to transform raw data into insights by making the non-visible visible, showing clear trends or patterns, and / or identifying outliers or missing information. The specific skills involved in achieving this goal include all of the course learning objectives.\nTeams: Your final project will be a team project made up of 2 to 3 classmates of your choosing. Teams will be finalized at the time of submitting your proposal.

For example, you might expect the price of gasoline over a particular period to be rather tightly-grouped around a mean, whereas the stock price of a particular company might vary much more widely over the same period.\nDescribe two relationships you expect to find among variables in your data (again, regardless of whether they actually exist in your data). For example, you might expect sales of hybrid vehicles to increase when gas prices increase; in this case, I am expecting that hybrid vehicle sales and gasoline prices are positively correlated.\nDescribe at least two charts that you expect will help you visualize the relationships that you expect to find. For example, a scatterplot of gasoline prices and hybrid vehicle sales over a particular time period might be useful for visualizing the level of correlation between these two variables.\nDiscuss how your expectations about the variables you chose will help inform you about your research question."

Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings."

Quizzes are designed to be time-intensive, to test for fluency, and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for just 15% of your final grade. If you do poorly on one, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

Remember that real firms are sponsoring student projects throughout the semester; in a workplace setting, these firms would be paying clients for the analyses being conducted. This course prepares students to succeed in the workplace, and maintaining a high degree of professionalism is expected."
