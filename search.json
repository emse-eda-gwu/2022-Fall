This analysis uses some statistical modeling (which won’t cover), but the use of visualizations alone are effective for addressing the research questions posed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF1 racing data analysis\nby Jonathan Bouchet. This is an extensive exploratory data analysis of a variety of data on races, drivers, and constructors across the history of Formula 1 racing. This would probably be overkill for a course project, but sections of it (e.g. section 3 on the races, or sections 4 and 5 together on the drivers and constructors) would make a nice project. It involves mutliple data sets, some not-so-simple data cleaning, and a wide variety of nice visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing Intensity of Strong Atlantic Hurricanes\nby James B. Elsner. This is a short analysis with the goal of validating the predictions of this study published in Nature in 2008, which predicted that Atlantic tropical cyclones would continue to get stronger on average over time. While this analysis is too short to be considered adequate for a final project, it is still a good example of good data source documentation and one effective visualization. An expanded inquiry into the questions addressed here would make a good course project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath: Reality vs Reported\nby Owen Shen. This is an interesting original analysis in which the author collected the data himself. The analysis compares whether the proportion of actual causes of death is consistent with the proportion of death causes that the media reports. This analysis also uses some interactive graphics so that the reader can view different versions of the same plot, such as scrolling through the plot over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre first babies more likely to be late?\nby Allen Downey. This is another relatively short analysis, but the author does a good job of documenting his data sources, stating the assumptions he makes, and also describes what data were dropped from the analysis (i.e. babies born via C-section).\n\n\n\n\nHistorically significant analyses\nExploratory data analysis has been around for a very long time. Here are some of the most historically famous.\n\n\n\n\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois’ “The Exhibit of American Negroes”\nIn 1900, W.E.B. Du Bois presented “The Exhibit of American Negroes” at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Du Bois described the exhibition as “Thirty-two charts, 500 photographs, and numerous maps and plans form the basis of this exhibit. The charts are in two sets, one illustrating conditions in the entire United States and the other conditions in the typical State of Georgia.” The charts in his exhibition are staggeringly powerful. This six-part series published in Nightingale displays and discusses many of his impressive visualizations. You can also purchase a book on the portraits on Amazon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinard’s Napoleon March Map\nThe “Napoleon March Map” by Charles Joseph Minard is widely viewed as one of the greatest data visualizations of all time. The chart depicts Napoleon’s disastrous campaign to conquer Moscow. Having started with around 470,000 soldiers, he returned with just 10,000. The width of the line represents the total number of soldiers and the color represents the direction (yellow for towards Moscow, black for the return trip).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTableau’s Top 10 GOAT Data Visualizations\nIt’s hard to say which data visualizations are the “Greatest Of All Time,” but Tableau put together a pretty excellent collection for their top 10 list."

I will not assign these often.\n✔ (100%): Responses are thoughtful, well-written, and show engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.\n✔− (50%): Responses are hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.\n\nNotice that this is essentially a pass/fail system. I’m not grading your writing ability and I’m not counting the number of words you write - I’m looking for thoughtful engagement. One or two sentences is not enough. Write at least a paragraph and show me that you did the readings assigned.\n\n\n1. Software\nIf you haven’t yet, go to the Course Software page and install all the software we’ll need for this course. You’ll need these tools for this assignment.\n\n\n2. Getting Organized\nDownload and edit this template when working through this assignment.\n\n\n3. Readings & Exercises\nUnzip the template folder (make sure you unzip it!), then open the .Rproj file to open RStudio. Open the hw1.Rmd file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the following readings / exercises:\n\nGetting Familiar with the Course: Follow Snoop’s advice and read the entire Course Syllabus (actually read the whole thing). Then review the schedule and make sure to note important upcoming deadlines.\nGetting Familiar with Tidy Data: Read this tidyverse article explaining the concept of tidy data.\nPractice Rehaping Messy Data: Go to this page and try loading at least one of the example data sets shown. Then try rehaping the data into a tidy format.\n\n\n\n4. Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your hw1.Rmd file.\n\n\n5. Submit\nTo submit this assignment, create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment. Name the zip file hw1-netID.zip, replacing netID with your netID (e.g., hw1-jph.zip).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Department: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nWrite a clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable research question.\nImport, manipulate, clean, visualize, and export data in R.\nWrangle data from its original format into a fit-for-purpose format.\nConduct a systematic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of different types of data.\nApply fundamental principles of visualizing information for exploratory analysis and communication.\nGet data off the web and expose data, code, results on the web.\nGenerate fully reproducible reports that contain code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n\nPrerequisites:\nStudents should have taken EMSE 4571: Intro to Programming for Analytics or have experience working with data in at least one programming language.

As such, the application of these principles to a real data problem is one of the best ways to learn and assess mastery of these skills. I guarantee you one day you will need to apply these principles to communicate an idea to colleagues, so let’s make sure you have at least one chance to practice before the stakes are higher.\nSkills & Knowledge: Your final project should illustrate your ability to transform raw data into insights by making the non-visible visible, showing clear trends or patterns, and / or identifying outliers or missing information. The specific skills involved in achieving this goal include all of the course learning objectives.\nTeams: Your final project will be a team project made up of 2 to 3 classmates of your choosing. Teams will be finalized at the time of submitting your proposal. Graduate students taking the course must work on individual projects.\nSummary of Deliverables: To make the overall project more manageable, it is broken down into separate “milestone” deliverables due throughout the semester, starting with a proposal due just before spring break.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nWeight towardsfinal grade\nDue Date(by 11:59pm)\n\n\n\n\nProposal\n9 %\nSep 27\n\n\nProgress Report\n12 %\nNov 1\n\n\nFinal Report\n16 %\nDec 11\n\n\nPresentation\n9 %\nDec 13"

For example, you might expect sales of hybrid vehicles to increase when gas prices increase; in this case, I am expecting that hybrid vehicle sales and gasoline prices are positively correlated.\nDescribe at least two charts that you expect will help you visualize the relationships that you expect to find. For example, a scatterplot of gasoline prices and hybrid vehicle sales over a particular time period might be useful for visualizing the level of correlation between these two variables.\nDiscuss how your expectations about the variables you chose will help inform you about your research question."

Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings."

Please show up on time to class each week to ensure that you do not miss a quiz.\nQuizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz. Quizzes are short (5-10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

For the remainder of the code, see: https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity\nIn addition to the formal code of academic integrity, the instructor expects that students will treat this course with the level of professionalism required in the workplace. Remember that real firms are sponsoring student projects throughout the semester; in a workplace setting, these firms would be paying clients for the analyses being conducted. This course prepares students to succeed in the workplace, and maintaining a high degree of professionalism is expected."
