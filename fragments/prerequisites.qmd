Students should have taken [EMSE 4571: Intro to Programming for Analytics](https://p4a.seas.gwu.edu/) or have experience working with data in at least one programming language. If you're not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing [this optional course prerequisites](hw/0-course-prereqs.qmd) assignment **before class starts**. Once class starts, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics.
