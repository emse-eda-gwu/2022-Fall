> **Due**: `r due`
>
> **Submit**: To submit this assignment, create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment. Name the zip file ``r paste0('hw', params$number, '-netID.zip')``, replacing `netID` with your netID (e.g., ``r paste0('hw', params$number, '-jph.zip')``). Use [this link](`r params$submit`) to submit your file.
>
> **Weight**: This assignment is worth 3% of your final grade.
>
> **Purpose**: `r params$purpose`
>
> **Assessment**: This assignment is graded using a check system:
>
> - ✔+ (110%): Responses shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often.
> - ✔ (100%): Responses are thoughtful, well-written, and show engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.
> - ✔− (50%): Responses are hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will _hopefully_ not assign these often.
>
> Notice that this is essentially a pass/fail system. I'm not grading your writing ability and I'm not counting the number of words you write - I'm looking for thoughtful engagement.
