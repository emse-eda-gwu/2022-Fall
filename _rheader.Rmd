> **Assessment**: This assignment is graded using a check system:
>
> - ✔+ (110%): Reflection shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often.
> - ✔ (100%): Reflection is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.
> - ✔− (50%): Reflection is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will _hopefully_ not assign these often.
>
> Notice that this is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. I'm not grading your writing ability, I'm not counting the exact number of words you write, and I'm not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading to prove that you did indeed read everything. I'm looking for thoughtful engagement, that's all. Do good work and you'll get a ✓.
